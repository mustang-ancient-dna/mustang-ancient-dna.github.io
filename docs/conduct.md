# Symposium Code of Conduct

All attendees, speakers, and volunteers at our events are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event. We expect cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everybody.

Our symposium is dedicated to providing a harassment-free symposium experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of symposium participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any symposium venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Event participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the events at the discretion of the organizers.
