#### Archaeology of the invisible: the biomolecular revolution in archaeology

> Recent advances in biomolecular technologies are opening up dramatic new opportunities in the field of archaeology. Among the most exciting new technologies to emerge is that of paleogenomics - the study of ancient DNA to reconstruct past genomes and answer key questions about the human past. Although the first attempts to recover ancient DNA can be traced to the 1980s, the field underwent a technological revolution in the 2010s with the advent of high throughput sequencing and is now among the most powerful methods in the archaeology toolkit. From identifying ancient human migrations and ancestry relationships to diagnosing and tracing the spread of infectious disease to reconstructing the ingredients and flavors of ancient foods, paleogenomics is transforming our understanding of the human past. Here we introduce three paleogenomics projects our team is conducting in Nepal and explain how ancient DNA can be used answer key questions about life in ancient Nepal - including how and when ancient peoples first settled the high Himalayan valleys, the antiquity of malaria and its spread by trade, and the ancient art of brewing chaang.

#### The High Himalayas Archaeological Project (HHARP) in Upper Mustang, 2010-2023

> The High Himalayas Archaeological Project (HHARP) in Upper Mustang is an interdisciplinary project that has involved archaeologists, bioarchaeologists, geneticists, and specialists in a wide range of archaeological sciences to explore the peopling of the Himalayas and subsequent cultural and biological adaptations to life at high elevation. Over the course of the project, the team has excavated and conducted research at seven archaeological sites in Mustang and neighboring Manang. Based on this research, we now know that people entered Mustang by 1500 BCE, and through the study of ancient DNA, have found that they are ultimately descended from peoples from the Tibetan plateau. Our research has revealed a complex set of mortuary practices over time, and archaeometric studies of glass beads, metals, and other artifacts show that Upper Mustang was connected societies to South Asia as well as Central Asia and the Middle East. This presentation outlines some of the primary results of the efforts of this extraordinary team of scientists.

#### Fossil Records from the Nepal Himalaya

> The collision of the Indian subcontinent to the Eurasian continent in early Cenozoic was an important event because it was responsible for the formation of the great Himalayan ranges and development of the monsoonal climatic system in the southern Asia. The continuous movement of the Indian Plate underneath the Tibetan Plate resulted in the long-term crustal deformation, exhumation and the development of the different EW trending thrust faults all across the Himalayas. These thrust are supposed to be formed to release excessive stress which caused major seismic events during the orogeny. On the basis of EW trending faults, the geology of the Nepal Himalaya is separated into five different tectonic units. From south to north, these are: (1) The Indo-Gangetic Plain, (2) The Sub-Himalaya or Siwalik also known as the Churia range, (3) The Lesser Himalaya, also known as Lower Himalaya. (4) The Higher Himalaya, also known as the Greater Himalaya and, (5) The Tethys Himalaya or Tibetan Sedimentary series (Fig. 1). The Himalayan Frontal Thrust (HFT) separates the Indo-Gangetic Plain in the south and the Siwalik to the north. The Main Boundary Thrust (MBT) separates the Siwalik and the Lesser Himalaya. Similarly the Main Central Thrust separates the Lesser Himalaya and the Higher Himalaya. The Higher Himalaya is separated with the Tethys Himalaya by normal fault system named as STDS (South Tibet Detachment System). The Tethys Himalaya ranges in age from Cambrian to Cretaceous. The Palaeozoic part of Tethys Himalaya is rich with invertebrate fossils such as Trilobites (Arthropoda), Gastropods, Pelecypods, Cephalopods, Crinoids (Echinoderms) and Conodonts (early fishes) while the Mesozoic part is rich with Cephalopods (ammonites/Shaligrams) and plant fossils such as Nilssonia, Otozamites, Ptilophyllum, Taeniopteris (leaves), Araucarioxylon nepalensis (permineralized tree trunk). The Cenozoic rocks of Nepal Himalaya are massively rich in Vertebrates (Gomphotherium, Deinotherium, Stegotetrabaladon, Stegodon, Hyppohyus, Brachyotherium, Hexaprotodon, Merycopotamus, Bos, Hemibos, Crocodylus, Gavialis, Giraffa, Shivapithcus (Hominid), Testudines and fish spp.). Pre-cambrian rocks in the Lesser Himalaya are rich in algal mats and Stromatolites (Colonial algae). The Tertiary rocks of Siwalik are rich in many angiosperm plant fossils. We will discuss their distribution and palaeoecological importance in this presentation.

> Present-day Tibetans have successfully acclimated to the high-altitude challenges of the Tibetan Plateau, sparking significant genetic interest in comprehending their adaptation to the hypoxic environment. Unraveling the origins of present-day Tibetans is crucial for understanding their genetic adaptation. To explore the history of the formation of the Tibetan gene pool, we conducted genome-wide analysis with 33 ancient individuals dating to ca. 1420 BCEâ€“650 CE. These individuals, most closely related to present-day Tibetans, represent an early branch within the Tibetan lineage, shedding light on the intricate history of the Tibetan gene pool. They derive most of their ancestry from groups related to Late Neolithic populations at the northeastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau. Additionally, they carry a minor genetic component originating from a distinct and ancient Paleolithic Eurasian ancestry. Unlike the Tibetan gene pool, present-day non-Tibetan Tibeto-Burman speakers residing at mid-elevations on the Plateau, exhibit the genetic clines that trace their ancestry back to Middle Neolithic populations in the Yellow River basin. Finally, we revealed the persistence of positive selection for high-altitude adaptive alleles through a comparison between ancient and present-day highlanders.

> In addition to representing a major modern public health threat, the malaria-causing parasite Plasmodium falciparum has exerted one of the strongest selective pressures shaping the human genome. Nevertheless, debate persists over when and how P. falciparum emerged as a human pathogen and spread around the globe. To explore the history of this disease, we used a metagenomic approach to identify ancient DNA from malaria parasites preserved in human skeletal remains. We present the earliest identified case of P. falciparum malaria in an individual from the high-altitude site of Chokhopani in Upper Mustang, Nepal, dating to c. 804-765 calBCE. This site lies above the endemic range of malaria-transmitting mosquitoes in Nepal today, suggesting that the individual from Chokhopani may have acquired their infection during travel in lowland regions. As such, this represents a rare case-study in which infectious disease status sheds light on both individual mobility and trans-altitudinal connectivity in the Himalayas.

> Integrons are genetic element and have a long history of its existence in microbial world. Until few decades ago they were futile to the scientific world but as their significance as a vehicle of antimicrobial resistance has surfaced. They have gained attention and many researchers around the world have been exploring them. In case of Nepal, though AMR are explored from every niches but studies on integrons are very limited. So, my current research focuses on these integrons and aim to highlight their epidemiological significance. Through genotypic confirmation of their presence in E. coli to genome sequences, I have been exploring integrons specifically class 1 integrons for diversity within different clones and evolution in their gene cassette. The finding suggested high prevalence of class 1 integrons within multiple antibiotic resistance E. coli and co-prevalence of other AMR genes of clinical significance. The genomic analysis revealed diversity in sequence type, plasmid type and phylogenetic result. Thus, the analysis so far has shown an alarming situation of AMR clones circulating in clinical setting of Nepal.

> Located some 4000 meters above sea level, in the Kali Gandaki river valley of the Upper Mustang region of Nepal, lies the sky cave of Samdzong. Archeological excavations conducted, between 2010 and 2012, revealed several tombs, among which the tomb 5, which contained human remains and cultural artifacts associated with food and beverage production. Among these artifacts, copper vessels, dated to the 6-7th century CE, are thought to be associated with the brewing and consumption of chhaang, a typical Tibetan barley wine. After conducting DNA extraction in a dedicated ancient DNA cleanroom facility, we shotgun and target captured and sequenced these samples, to check both for plant and microbiome composition. The microbial signal present in these samples revealed an assortment of microbes associated with alcoholic fermentation, while the plant DNA matched with barley reference genomes. Taken together, these findings suggest the production of chhaang in the Upper Mustang region in the early 7th century CE.
