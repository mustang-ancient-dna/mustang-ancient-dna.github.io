#### Archaeology of the invisible: the biomolecular revolution in archaeology


Recent advances in biomolecular technologies are opening up dramatic new opportunities in the field of archaeology. Among the most exciting new technologies to emerge is that of paleogenomics - the study of ancient DNA to reconstruct past genomes and answer key questions about the human past. Although the first attempts to recover ancient DNA can be traced to the 1980s, the field underwent a technological revolution in the 2010s with the advent of high throughput sequencing and is now among the most powerful methods in the archaeology toolkit. From identifying ancient human migrations and ancestry relationships to diagnosing and tracing the spread of infectious disease to reconstructing the ingredients and flavors of ancient foods, paleogenomics is transforming our understanding of the human past. Here we introduce three paleogenomics projects our team is conducting in Nepal and explain how ancient DNA can be used answer key questions about life in ancient Nepal - including how and when ancient peoples first settled the high Himalayan valleys, the antiquity of malaria and its spread by trade, and the ancient art of brewing chaang.

#### The High Himalayas Archaeological Project (HHARP) in Upper Mustang, 2010-2023

The High Himalayas Archaeological Project (HHARP) in Upper Mustang is an interdisciplinary project that has involved archaeologists, bioarchaeologists, geneticists, and specialists in a wide range of archaeological sciences to explore the peopling of the Himalayas and subsequent cultural and biological adaptations to life at high elevation. Over the course of the project, the team has excavated and conducted research at seven archaeological sites in Mustang and neighboring Manang. Based on this research, we now know that people entered Mustang by 1500 BCE, and through the study of ancient DNA, have found that they are ultimately descended from peoples from the Tibetan plateau. Our research has revealed a complex set of mortuary practices over time, and archaeometric studies of glass beads, metals, and other artifacts show that Upper Mustang was connected societies to South Asia as well as Central Asia and the Middle East. This presentation outlines some of the primary results of the efforts of this extraordinary team of scientists.
