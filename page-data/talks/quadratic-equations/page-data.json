She developed a method for solving quadratic equations by completing the square, which is still taught today.</p>\n<p>Hypatia's method of completing the square was a significant breakthrough in the study of quadratic equations. It was a more systematic and general method than the ad hoc methods used by previous mathematicians, and it allowed for the solution of more complex quadratic equations.</p>\n<p>Hypatia's work on quadratic equations was not limited to theoretical developments. She also used her knowledge of quadratic equations to solve practical problems, such as determining the dimensions of a rectangular field given its area and the length of its diagonal.</p>\n<p>Her method of completing the square is still used today, and her work on the properties of quadratic equations laid the foundation for further developments in algebra and mathematics.</p>"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1114193004","1540883560","1565398047","532230899","673610691"],"slicesMap":{}}
